Hiya, welcome to ember

Yes, that's intentionally stylized with all lower-case, I'm not *that* poor of a typist.

ember is a little software blog - to be really honest it's mostly just a personal notepad, intended as the companion to my aim of getting good at software development again.

That's a bit of a weird statement, and I do appreciate that without intimate knowledge of my own history, progression and ultimate 'downfall', it's not particularly apparent what I mean. It's also a statement I know a few people would disagree with, so let me indulge myself and give you a brief rundown, which might help me explain why I felt that this little website was a particularly necessary use of Vercel's bandwith and Github's storage.

When I finished High School, I was pretty shit at coding.

I'd written some basic Python and C++, but by-and-large it was tutorial hell and the code itself wasn't particularly good regardless.

As I started my first year of university, I made a real effort to learn and 'git gud' (pun absolutely intended). I picked up git, started writing more complex C++ systems, and started a youtube channel, [Ellie Makes Games](https://www.youtube.com/@elliemakesgames), to show off the progress on my then main project, a game called Project Isolation. My first year of uni was pretty easy, I had plenty of time to work on the project, and I felt like I was growing rapidly. In a year, I'd gone from not really knowing much about git, C++ and programming in general, to using git across a number of projects, building my first portfolio website, and having a modicum of success on YouTube with Project Isolation (the 3rd devlog in particular hit 10,000 views, which for me is pretty huge to this day).

I felt like I was growing rapidly.

Near the end of that summer, I launched FPS Core. It was a simple side-project (intended to provide a simpler means of integrating Project Isolation's source code into your own project) that blew up after launch, hitting something like 30,000 downloads in the first month. I pivoted to work on that, and learned so much about maintianing a community, supporting a live product, writing documentation, and delivering updates. I'd say the first few months of this process where when I felt at my strongest as a developer. I was building something meaningful, improving constantly, and to top it all off, my social life had improved, and I was even managing a consistent sleep schedule :p

Off the back of FPS Core, I was able to get my first job as a frontend software engineer working at an agency in mid 2023. That summer, I learned frontend development from scratch, building websites with React, Next.js and Tailwind. As I returned to school for my penultimate year, this pace of learning slowly started to dry up. I'd learned what I needed to at my job, and the job itself would slowly wind down as the money dried up and clients moved to other agencies. I switched jobs, moving towards a VR developer role which promised to be closer to my game development roots. However, beyond an initial re-build of my employer's unity project (which had sat unmaintained for some time, and needed a rework), my role turned more towards content creation, initially customizing the content of VR apps to different clients, and ultimately ending up as an AI prompt engineer, generating AI images and videos for a pre-existing software platform.

While I was grateful for the money, I felt like I wasn't really stretching any programming muscle, at least not at work. University proved a different problem, that ultimately led to the same result. Every course at university requested knowledge in a different set of skills, tools and languages. One course required C, another Python, and a third JS/TS. They were more focused on learning concepts of the course itself than any actual programming.

I would like to point out here that that's not a bad thing - concepts and their implementation are incredibly important, and I'm grateful to have the knowledge and experience of building, among other coursework, digital twins, computer vision algorithms and neural networks.

What I *am* saying though is that I didn't feel like any of these improved my actual skills as a *programmer*. When I sit down and look at a job listing from companies of any sizes, I don't feel like I'm better off for having done those courses (which, to be fair, is a whole discussion of it's own, but maybe for another time).

Alongside work and uni, I co-founded a game studio to build an FPS/RTS game called Warbound. You might expect that this would be my outlet - finally a project where I could focus on just bettering my programming skills. Unfortunately, this wasn't *quite* the case. With Warbound, we decided to build our project off of the Lyra sample provided by Epic Games. I still back our decision to go this way, but it meant that a large part of the first 6 months was simply rewriting code directly from Lyra. It was essentially copy-pasting, but with the added hassle of writing out every word by hand. By the time we got to starting to build out new content, I was in my final semester of university, juggling my job, courses, and job applications. By the time I got back to Warbound, the whole codebase was so unapproachable to me I wasn't really able to write any code before leaving to cycle across the UK, walk to a pub, and move out of my flat in favour of my parents couch (it's... a *lot* cheaper).

All that has left me feeling like I haven't really done any meaninful, impactful coding for nearly the last 2 years.

I feel out of practice, out of my depth, and frankly like a bit of an idiot.

I also feel like a horrible liar any time I apply to a job. I proudly list all my accomplishments on my resumé and cover letter, without feeling like I'd be able to achieve any of those again, should I try to today.

I do view these last 2 years as somewhat of a downfall, a departure from a consistent growth trajectory that's left me in an uncertain, uncomfortable, and unpleasant situation.

I do also appreciate that part of that is likely fueled by the recent lack of stability in my life, and that I've started too many of the last sentences with "I".

That pretty much brings you up to speed. ember is a goal for me to re-gain my programming legs. It's an effort to write more software in more varied areas, in particular with employability as a focus. I'll be trying to post weekly here - a little check in, in addition to the github commits, to walk through what I'm building and how.

If you do happen to find this (which I'd be surprised by, given that I've gone for the timeless marketing strategy of give it out for free and tell nobody about it), I hope it's at least a little entertaining or useful. Ultimately though, it's mostly just for me.

With that in mind, I'm gonna get going on some of the other aspects of this project.

Cheers for stopping by,

~ Ellie ❤️
